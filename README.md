## Description

The following code has been developed specifically for the kilobots [1]. The code was compiled using the [kilolib library](https://github.com/acornejo/kilolib) in its state in June, 2018. For local compilation, please refer to https://www.kilobotics.com/ .

The code has been adapted to the simulator Kilombo [2]. Please refer to https://github.com/JIC-CSB/kilombo to install the simulator and/or understand the syntax.

The algorithm assumes the kilobots have been calibrated for left and right motion. Calibration for forward motion is not required.
